AI-Project-VacuumEnvironment
============================

An environment to test a vacuum agent, created for the university project of Prof. Milani's Artificial Intelligence course at Department ofMathematicasandComputer Science, University ofPerugia, and inspired from a problem posed by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig in the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach".
